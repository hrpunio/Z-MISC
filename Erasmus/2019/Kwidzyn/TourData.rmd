## Eurostat data
### Introduction

Tourism, in a statistical context, refers to the activity of visitors
taking a trip to a destination outside their usual environment, for
less than a year. It can be for any main purpose, including business
or leisure. (cf https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/tourism)

Eurostat statistics on tourism statistics consist of two main components:

* Capacity and occupancy of tourist establishments (Supply Side)

* Tourism trips (Demand Side)

Capacity data refer notably to the number of establishments and the
number of bed places, while occupancy data refer to the number of
arrivals at accommodation establishments and the number of nights
spent. (cf https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/tourism/data/database tour_indm/tour_inda)

Tourism trips (data) refer to the number of tourists and tourism trips
made. They are available broken down by main characteristics of the
trip, such as destination, duration, mode of transport used, or
expenditure, as well as by socio-demographic characteristics of the
tourists, such as age and gender.
(cf https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/tourism/data/database tour_dem)

## GUS (Polish Statistical Main Office) 

At GUS WWW page data is published as spreadsheets on yearly basis. There is
no access to the database (with some interface). Note however
that data from Eurostat on nights spent/arrivals/occupancy rate shoud be idenctical to data published by GUS (so no need to use GUS data.)

Tourism in 2017, 2016, 2015
(https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/culture-tourism-sport/tourism/tourism-in-2017,1,15.html; https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/culture-tourism-sport/tourism/tourism-in-2016,1,14.html; https://stat.gov.pl/en/topics/culture-tourism-sport/tourism/tourism-in-2015,1,13.html)

There is a separate interface to GUS data (BDL) but it mainly contains 
information on tourist infrastructure not traffic/usage.
