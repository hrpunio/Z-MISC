If pro is the opposite of con, and progress 
is moving forward, what is congress?
See paragraph <pref refid='congr.def'/> for
an answer </p>
<!-- ... omitted p elements -->
<p id='congr.def'>According to Professor Squealer 
<q>Con In Latin means together 
and Gradi means to walk.  Congradi literally 
means meeting. This became congressus 
and then Congress in English.</q> 
BTW recontre is the verb to meet in French...
