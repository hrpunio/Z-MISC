The database was download from (on 6.12.2018T8:00):

\begin{verbatim}

\end{verbatim}

The NTSB aviation accident database contains information from 1962 and
later about civil aviation accidents and selected incidents within the
United States, its territories and possessions, and in international
waters.

\subsection{What/where/when}\label{whatwherewhen}

\subsubsection{What}\label{what}

accident = defined precisely http://www.iprr.org/manuals/Annex13.html

incident = less serious

https://aviation.stackexchange.com/questions/14074/what-is-the-difference-between-aviation-accident-and-incident

Where = within the United States, its territories and possessions, and
in international waters Not clear what does it precisely mean (within
US?)

Moreover

\begin{verbatim}
awkF '$6 !="United States" {print $0}' AviationData.csv | wc -l

Internal flight, from Koszalin to ZiÄ™bice. Relation to US is unclear
\end{verbatim}

So we define our set: which occured in US (thus excluding outbound
international flights and those crashed over ocean)

\begin{verbatim}
awkF '$6 == "United States" {print $6}' AviationData.csv > AviationData_US.csv
\end{verbatim}

\subsubsection{When}\label{when}

The file is dynamic and grows every day. The first observation is 1948

I rename the file to AviationData.csv

\begin{verbatim}
wc -l AviationData.csv

How many occured in USA:

\begin{verbatim}
awkF '$6 == "United States" {print $6}' AviationData.csv | wc -l

How many resulted in more than 100 fatalInjuries

\begin{verbatim}
awkF '$24 > 100 {print $24}' AviationData.csv | wc -l

How many resulted in at least one fatalInjury

\begin{verbatim}
awkF '$24 > 0 {print $24}' AviationData.csv | wc -l

We create two files:AvData\_USA\_All.csv and AvData\_USA\_Fatal.csv

\begin{verbatim}

Our further analysis concerns AvData\_USA\_Fatal.csv

We limit our analysis further (when = 1982 and earlier)

\begin{verbatim}
awkF '$24 > 0 && $6 == "United States" {print $24}' AvData_USA_1982A.csv > AvData_USA_1982F.csv
