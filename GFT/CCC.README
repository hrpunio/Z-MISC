On Road Cyclist Crashes, since 2012, which have been reported by the Police or the Public through the AFP Crash Report Form. Please note; Although crash data is updated on regular bases it will always have a backlog of entries hence it is not a true reflection of the up to date crash locations. Crash locations are only indicative and may not reflect an accurate position of persons involved in an incident. Casualty crashes are occasionally omitted from some maps or crash reports if they are still under investigation.
